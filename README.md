# parai2c
Simple I2C interface on parallel port for PC or Atari

* Hardware and software needed

You need the following to get this program working :

\- Computer with parallel port on which you can read and write<br>
\- Borland C compatible compiler for DOS, Pure C on Atari<br>

* List of programs

\- i2cbus.cpp : main code of the driver from 1998 or 1999<br>
\- \\SAVE : some previous versions for archival purpose<br>
\- \\schs : pcb layers at 300 dpi to print transparent layers<br>

* How to use it

Look into the source file, everything is pretty much self explanatory.

* Known limitations

Very old software, perhaps my first C++ code ever. The PCB file schematic was done on Atari.

* Some infos

Worked pretty well to command a audio mixer chip through I2C.
